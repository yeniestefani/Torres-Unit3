<h1> Fairy Tail Characters </h1>
 <div>
 <p> Fairy Tail is an anime that follows the story of a young girl, Lucia Heartfillia, on her adventure to becoming a Fairy Tail wizard. She then meets three other wizards, Natsu Dragneel, Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet and an exceed(a flying and talking cat) Happy. Together the four of them create a team and join each other on many adventures and create bonds much too powerful to be destroyed. In this website </p>
<p> In this website, I will be talking about three Fairy Tail characters. These characters are characters that I like and have fascinated me. Their stories have captured my attention and have had big impacts in the anime. </p>
