 <p> Zeref is known as the "Black Wizard" or the "Killing Mage." He is considered the most evil and darkest Mage in the history of the Magic World. He is around 400 years old due to the fact that he cursed himself. He mastered Black Magic, gave birth to thousands of Demons and threw the world into chaos. He, however, tried to end his life after this claiming he did not want to kill anymore. However that's when he cursed himself to be inmortal. His final masterpiece was an Etherious, E.N.D., that is meant to kill him. He also expresses his desire to meet Natsu Dragneel since Natsu is the Mage meant to kill him. Zeref prefers to stay isolated and lives in the secluded Tenrou Island, the sacred ground for Fairy Tail. Zeref does not want to kill anymore, however he states that if the world keeps rejecting him, than he will reject the world as well. </p> </body>
