 <p> Zeref is known as the "Black Wizard" or the "Killing Mage." He is considered the most evil and darkest Mage in the history of the Magic World. He is around 400 years old due to the fact that he cursed himself. He mastered Black Magic, gave birth to thousands of Demons and threw the world into chaos. He, however, tried to end his life after this and that is when he cursed himself to be imortal. However, his final masterpiece was an Etherious, E.N.D., that is meant to kill him.  </p>
